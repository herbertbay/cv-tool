# Next steps for fast organic growth — Optimal CV

Ideas to grow Optimal CV through SEO, content, and word-of-mouth without (or before) paid spend.

---

## Messaging (pain → solution)

Use the “ghosted / ignored” angle consistently so people recognize the problem and the fix:

- **Hero / above the fold:** “Tired of being ghosted by recruiters? Get a CV that gets you noticed.”
- **Why tailor:** “Stop getting ignored—stand out with Optimal CV.”
- **Final CTA:** “Tired of silence after applying? Make your next CV impossible to ignore.”
- **Alternatives for ads or social:** “Ghosted after applying? Your CV might be the reason.” / “Stop sending the same CV to every job. Stand out with Optimal CV.”

Keep the tone direct and empathetic; avoid sounding preachy or desperate.

## 1. Double down on SEO and intent capture

- **Target one job per page.** Create thin, high-intent pages: “CV for [Job Title]” (e.g. “CV for Software Engineer”, “CV for Marketing Manager”). Each page: short intro, 3–5 tailored tips, strong CTA to use Optimal CV. Use job titles as H1s and in meta titles/descriptions.
- **Answer “how to” queries.** Publish 1–2 posts per month that match real search demand: “How to tailor your CV to a job description”, “How to pass ATS screening”, “Best CV format for [year]”, “How to write a cover letter for [industry]”. Keep articles practical and link to the product where it solves the problem.
- **Internal linking.** Link from every article and job page to the main app (Get started / Build your CV). Add a “Resources” or “Blog” section on the site and link to it from the footer.
- **Technical SEO.** Ensure the landing and key pages are indexable, have canonical URLs, and load fast. Consider a sitemap and simple schema (e.g. FAQ, HowTo) where it fits.

## 2. One “viral” free tool (lead magnet)

- **CV / ATS “score” or “check”.** A single page: paste job description + CV text (or upload), get a short “match score” and 3–5 improvement tips. No signup for the check; optional “Save full report” or “Get a tailored CV” → signup. Shareable and linkable.
- **Job description keyword extractor.** Paste a job ad → get a list of suggested keywords to use in a CV. Free, no account; CTA: “Use these in a CV tailored by Optimal CV”.
- **Simple, shareable result.** Design the result so people can share it (“I got 78% match”) or at least talk about it. Add “Share” or “Try with your CV” to encourage loops.

## 3. Content that gets backlinks and shares

- **Data-led content.** One “state of hiring” or “CV screening” piece per quarter: survey or scrape public data (e.g. what keywords appear in job posts, how long applications are open). Pitch to career/job sites and newsletters for links and mentions.
- **Comparison pages.** “Optimal CV vs. [X]” or “Best tools to tailor your CV in [year]” — fair, factual, and include Optimal CV. These often rank and get shared in forums and Reddit.
- **Templates and examples.** “10 CV summary examples for [role]” or “Cover letter opening lines that get read.” Host on your site, optimize for search, and add a CTA to generate a full CV/letter with Optimal CV.

## 4. Community and “where they already are”

- **Subreddits and forums.** r/resumes, r/careerguidance, r/jobs, r/cscareerquestions, etc. Be helpful first (answer questions, give feedback), mention Optimal CV only when it directly solves the ask. Avoid spam; aim for one valuable comment per day.
- **LinkedIn.** Short posts: “One change that made my CV get more callbacks”, “Why I tailor my CV for every application.” Link to the free tool or the product in the first comment or bio.
- **Quora / similar Q&A.** Answer “How do I improve my CV?” and “How do I tailor my resume?” with clear, actionable answers and a soft plug for Optimal CV where relevant.

---

## 5. Referral and sharing built into the product

- **“Share your result.”** After generating a CV: “Share Optimal CV with a friend — they get [X], you get [Y]” (e.g. extra template, priority support, or just goodwill). One-click copy link or share to LinkedIn/Twitter.
- **Light branding on free tier.** Optional “Created with Optimal CV” (or “Tailored with Optimal CV”) on the PDF. Make it easy to turn off for paid users. Every application becomes a potential referral.
- **Referral tracking.** Simple referral codes or UTM links so you can measure which channels and users bring signups. Double down on what works.

---

## 6. Email and retention (so organic traffic converts)

- **Welcome sequence.** After signup: 1) confirm + “Create your first tailored CV”; 2) “Tip: paste the job description for best results”; 3) “Your CV is ready — here’s how to use it for the next application.”
- **Re-engagement.** If they haven’t generated in 2–3 weeks: “Ready for your next application? Add a new job and we’ll tailor your CV again.” Keeps the product top of mind.
- **One valuable email per month.** Short career/CV tip or product update. Builds habit and gives a reason to reopen the app.

---

## 7. PR and “social proof” without a big budget

- **Founder story.** “Why I built a CV tool that tailors to every job” — Medium, LinkedIn, or your blog. Easy to pick up by indie/product newsletters.
- **Testimonials.** Ask early users for one sentence + permission to use name/role. Put 3–5 on the landing and in the app. “X people have created tailored CVs” (if true) adds credibility.
- **“As used by” or “Featured in”.** When you get a single mention (newsletter, blog, forum), add it to the site. One logo or quote is enough to start.

## 8. Prioritization for “fast” organic growth

| Priority | Action | Why |
|----------|--------|-----|
| 1 | Launch one free “viral” tool (score or keyword extractor) | Drives signups and shares with minimal content production. |
| 2 | Add referral/share CTA + optional PDF branding | Turns every user into a potential acquirer. |
| 3 | Publish 5–10 “CV for [Job Title]” pages + 2–3 “how to” posts | Captures high-intent search and builds topical authority. |
| 4 | Show up in 1–2 communities (e.g. r/resumes, LinkedIn) | Builds trust and direct traffic without ads. |
| 5 | Simple email sequence + one re-engagement email | Converts and brings back organic signups. |

Start with one item from the top two rows; measure signups and shares; then add the next. Organic growth compounds when you consistently ship one lever at a time and keep the product easy to try and share.
